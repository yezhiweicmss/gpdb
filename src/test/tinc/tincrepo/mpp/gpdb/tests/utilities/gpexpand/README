Tests for gpexpand utility

How to run:
From the root folder, just do tinc.py discover .

Prerequisites:
-> GPEXPAND_HOSTS environment variable needs to be set. 
   This is a space separated list of hostnames that includes all the hosts involved in the expansion tests. For eg: GPEXPAND_HOSTS='rh55-qavm44 rh55-qavm45'

-> PGDATABASE environment variable set to a valid database

-> GPDB / HAWQ binaries installed on the host where the tests are running. Note that we need not have an initialized cluster as the tests take care of initializing a required cluster

-> GPDB / HAWQ binaries installed on all the hosts involved in the expansion tests. This requirement might be removed  when the framework is enhanced to take care of seg install


Design:
TBD
