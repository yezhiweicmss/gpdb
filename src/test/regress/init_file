# We have disabled ignoring NOTICE statements because some tests rely on these
# NOTICEs to verify that the test is correct e.g (vacuum). Ignoring them would
# cause these tests to pass even when there is some discrepancy in the NOTICE
# statements when they should actually fail. We would still like to ignore some
# NOTICE statements which are harmless and show up regulary, will make it
# easier to merge postgres tests and which keep changing with test runs.

# The following NOTICE is generated when the user does not explicitly specify a
# distribution policy for a table. It is to inform the user that the database
# will pick a particular column in order to distribute the data. Merging tests
# from postgres will cause the tests to output these messages and we would need
# to manually modify the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore
# these.
m/^NOTICE:.*Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause -- Using column named '.*' as the Greenplum Database data distribution key for this table./

# The following NOTICE is generated when a partitioned table is created. For
# each child partition that gets created, it will generate a NOTICE saying that
# it is creating that particular partition. Certain tests add anonymous
# partitions and the names of these anonymous partitions will change across test
# runs.
# E.g CREATE TABLE will create partition "hhh_1_prt_r1987544232" for table "hhh" 
#     CREATE TABLE will create partition "hhh_1_prt_r1987553186" for table "hhh"
m/^NOTICE:.*CREATE TABLE will create partition ".*" for table ".*"/

# The following NOTICE is generated when creating a role. It is to inform the
# user that the database will assign the default resource queue to the role if
# the user has not explicitly specified one. Merging tests from postgres will
# cause the tests to output these messages and we would need to manually modify
# the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore these.
m/^NOTICE:.*resource queue required -- using default resource queue ".*"/

# The following NOTICE is generated when a user creates an index on the parent
# partition table. For each child partition, it informs the user that the
# database will create an index for that parition. The messages might appear in
# different order for the child partitions.
m/^NOTICE:.*building index for child partition ".*"/

# The following NOTICE is generated when a user tries to split a partition or
# exchange a partition with the default partition.
# In case of split partitions we end up creating temp tables to exchange the partitions
# E.g exchanged partition "p1" of relation "parttest_t" with relation "pg_temp_4062621"
m/^NOTICE:.*exchanged partition ".*" with relation ".*"/

# The following two NOTICEs are generated when user runs CREATE function. In
# some cases, when the database creates a function internally, the NOTICE might
# have OIDs embedded in it.
# For e.g  NOTICE:  return type pg_atsdb_133977_2_3 is only a shell. It is not
# really providing useful information to the user and hence can be ignored.
m/^NOTICE:.*return type .* is only a shell/

m/^NOTICE:.*argument type .* is only a shell/

# The following NOTICE is generated when a user creates a table with no
# columns. E.g CREATE TABLE foo(). It is to inform the user that database
# cannot find any columns on which to distribute the data. Merging tests from
# postgres might cause the tests to output these messages and we would need to
# manually modify the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore
# these.
m/^NOTICE:.*Table has no attributes to distribute on./

# The following NOTICE is generated when user runs ANALYZE. The NOTICE message
# generated seems to be non deterministic in that separate test runs produce
# the NOTICE for different tables and different number of tables. For E.g in one
# test run it produced the following NOTICE for pg_auth and in other it
# produced a NOTICE for pg_auth and pg_auth_constraints.
m/^NOTICE:.*ANALYZE detected all empty sample pages for table .*, please run VACUUM FULL for accurate estimation/
